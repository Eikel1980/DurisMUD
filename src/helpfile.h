/*
	Function:	string getHelpfile(string inputParameter)
	Preconditons:
	  1. inputParameter contains alphanumeric text input directly from the command input from a player.
	     Example:  User types "help commands" then inputParameter should be "commands"
	  2. IMPORTANT - operating system can have more than 8 character filenames.  (most modern ones do, to my knowledge)
	     (my assumptions are pretty basic for current operating systems, but I just want to make sure you know)
	Postconditions:
	     the inputParameter will be cleaned of all non-alphanumeric characters before further processing
	     IF preconditions are met, two outcomes can follow:
	  a) A string will be returned, which is the output of the helpfile that matches search inquiry
	     described in inputParameter
	  b) A default string will be returned, indicating failure to find specified file.
	     IF precondition 1a is failed, then the inputParameter will be cleaned of all characters that cause failure
	     until precondition is met, and then function will continue.
	     IF for whatever reason inputParameter cannot be cleaned, or is empty after cleaning, see outcome b.
	NOTES:
	     All spaces/tabs/punctuation will be removed
