&+R18/10/06&n
&+WDuris is back home in sweden.
- Make sure you connect using duris.game-host.org. 443 and 6666 and 4444.
  durismud.com works, but it rounds trips to us, and will provide most
  everyone with extra lag, so do not use it for a few days.

&+R15/10/06&n
- The duration of the spell 'minor paralysis' has been lowered and is now
  level dependant.

&+R14/10/06&n
- The procs for &+yAmbran&n and &+rDeath Rider&n have been upgraded.

&+R13/10/06&n
- Removed a mob from Bahamut's Palace that was being dimmed to in order to
  cheese the zone.
- Players who have followed the path of the multiclass, but then have decided
  to return to the simple life, can now pray to the gods of Duris at the Altar
  of the &+RMadMaN&n in the center of the &+WLost Temple of &+GTikitzopl&n. 
  Doing so requires an epic skillpoint.
- The damage from saved Solbeep's missles has been increased.
- Being hasted was unintentionally guaranteeing that you always succeeded AGI 
  checks. Changed to a bonus modifier instead of insta-success.

&+R09/10/06&n
- The news is now correctly updated on the website.

&+R05/10/06&n
- Lowered move drain while running from pvp fights, a tad.
- Casters get a few extra spellslots to compensate for everyone having extra 
  hitpoints.
- Rogues now ignore the move penalty for the first few seconds after a flee,
  giving them a chance to get back to the battle and stab!

&+R05/10/06&n
  &+YBig Changes&n
- Adjusted the hps changes, so they a little less drastic. Lowered
  the affect of damroll generaly so you get less extra damage / damroll you get.
  Lowered the bonus for damroll and hitroll / level bonus a bit.

- Base hitpoints for players has been dramatically increased.
- All players now receive a major level dependant hit/dam bonus.
- Mobs will now deal more damage to players.
- After engaging in pvp, your moves will decrease while you move much faster 
  until you calm down.

  The purpose of these changes is to reduce dependency on hit/dam/hp equipment, 
  so that you can fill those slots with more appropriate +stat gear. It will 
  also hopefully lead to longer and more interesting battles, and the movement 
  code should prevent people from running away too easily. As with everything, 
  we will be monitoring this change and will be adjusting accordingly.

&+R29/09/06&n
- Evil races can now see a few squares on the map during the day.
- Magical darkness should no longer blind goodies.
- Goodies should now be able to see better in the UD.
- If you notice anything funky about this, &+YDON'T PANIC&n, please
  just report it and we will get it fixed ASAP.

&+R14/09/06&n
- The map movement code has changed, and now only groups with more than 4 will be heard.

&+R13/09/06&n
- Grey Elves and Goblins can now choose to follow the dark path of the Rogue.

&+R12/09/06&n
  &+GEpic Zone Changes Part II&n
- There is a new command, "epic zones" which shows you all the epic zones in the
  world.
- Epic zones that are done too frequently will become less valuable, and epic zones
  that are rarely done will become even more valuable over time (up to 2x!). The
  epic zone listing will show epic zones that are particularly common or rare.
- This feature does not affect the epic leveling, if you have enough exp and epics 
  for the stone level you will level regardless of the frequency.
- As with any new feature, it is liable to be tweaked for specifics, so don't panic :)

&+R07/09/06&n
- Mortals can now use the "arti unique" and "arti ioun" commands. The list of
  uniques on mobs is still purchasable from the mob in Aravne.

&+R06/09/06&n
  &+GEpic Zone Changes&n
- There is now no epic zone trophy penalty (you can still see your trophy, but it
  doesn't affect the epic payout).
- When touching a stone, everyone in your group in the room will automatically
  receive epics. There is no group size limit, the epics will be shared equally.
- Epic leveling after level 51, like 44-51, now only requires you to level at 
  one of the listed zones (how this works is liable to change in the near future, 
  but for now: &+Renjoy&n!)
- 1.0 frags is now worth 20 epic points.

&+R29/08/06&n
- New command, "trophy frags", will show you the people you've fragged, and how
  many times you've been in on the kill (not the total value of frags gained from
  them). This is just for your own private viewing pleasure, having a high number 
  here won't affect frags gained in the future.
- Stat pools no longer have the chance to reduce your stats.
- Guild golems no longer require upkeep.

&+R28/08/06&n
- The shopkeepers of Duris have learned how to buy and sell faster.

&+R28/07/06&n
- Lightning bolts, are now the most overpowered spell in game.
  We back up now and should be where we left of, only thing missing
  is the router. But it shouldt affect game play to much, we back on the
  old one i had to reboot to get rid of lag, but a new of same kind as the
  burned out one, is on way (:
  Thanks for your patience, oh and this sucked!
  
  /Kvark

&+R16/07/06&n
- Characters over 51 will now get exp back from resses (no idea why that was disabled).
- Guard skill should now work way more often.

- New guild command, "soc l", which will show leaders the guild
  ledger (list of guild money transactions).
- Holy weapon proc on Ambran and Death Rider changed slightly.
- The construction of guild teleporters has been reenabled.

&+R04/07/06&n
- The darkness and continual light spells have been changed in regards
  to each other.
- Healing salve was moved to 6th circle for healer specced clerics.
- Teleport traps should be more efficient, be warned.

&+R03/07/06&n
- The Labyrinth of No Return is now truly more difficult to roam around
  in by magical means.

&+R02/07/06&n
- Guild shops have been disabled.

&+R28/06/06&n
- Mobs can now cast disintegrate. Be careful!
- Sorcerers have lost disintegrate from their spell list.
- Touching epic stones with more than one char, taking them out of
  zone, or portaling people in is considered mutliplaying and will be
  punished as such.
- The guard skill should be easier to notch now.
- Ship contact IDs are now randomly assigned.
- Guilds can no longer build teleporters between their guildhalls/OPs.

&+R27/06/06&n
- Saves bonus from spirit ward and greater spirit ward are flag
  bound now (eq will grant it as well).
- Greater spirit ward no longer blocks fire and coldshield but it
  blocks negative shield and all kinds of soulshield. Consider this
  change a testing phase, we may revert it if doesn't work fine.
- Potions of flight are no longer rentable. We will try to find some
  reasonable replacement for this spell.

&+R25/06/06&n

- Fix to bandage the best one it was healing 9000 hps instead of 900
  a typo done when i downgraded em a while back, sorry.

- New immortal rule:
  You cannot play duris if you want to have a god.

&+R18/11/06&n
- We are testing a new variant of AC calculation: it is based on item
  material and slot now instead of using hardcoded values. This should
  help us standardize values some and introduce explicit APPLY_ARMOR
  bonuses later.
- Feel free to report on bugs forum items that have wrong/unapropriate
  material types, since this affects their AC now.
- Conjurer mobs finally discovered the existence of stornogs spheres.

&+R16/11/06&n
- Armor type spells have been changed. Main part of the protection granted
  by all is non-stackable and shows in score as Armor. There is still some
  stackable part left so multiple spells give benefit. Barkskin reduction
  was converted to a large AC bonus working similarly to Armor flag. It is 
  possible to find items granting armor but expect this effect to be 
  extremely rare.
- Intellect fortress power bonus was reduced.
- Halflings run around more comfortably with bare feet.

&+R15/11/06&n
- Small change to bartender quest timers:
  You can always do 2 quests / RL day atleast, if you sub lvl 50 you can also do
  2 quest / level.

&+R15/06/06&n
- Stone skin and biofeedback on mobs works differently now: it is
  refreshable. Since this change may introduce some balance issues
  we'll watch it carefuly.

&+R13/06/06&n
- A couple potions and scrolls available in stores have been
  altered.

&+R8/06/06&n
- The zones required for level 51 have changed.

&+R7/06/06&n
- &+LDayblind for Evils&n
  Relive the glory days of Duris by being blind during the day (as an evil) or hiding
  like a wussy until the sun comes up (as a good)!

  The main evil races (Drow, Duergar, Troll, Ogre, Githyanki) can no longer see during the
  day. Orcs and neutral races (Minotaurs, Harpies) are unaffected.

  Races affected by this can hide in forest or swamp squares and are unaffected (although
  they can't see the map during the day).

  Due to the special Ship Sunglasses installed in all ships in the world of Duris, all races
  can see the same while sailing.

  Globe of darkness is now a self-only spell, available to necromancers at the 9th circle.

  Nightbringer lost globe of darkness, but has a new proc.

  All of this is subject to tweaking, so please test it out, and we will be monitoring the
  situation if anything needs to be changed.

  Since this is a major change, I (Torgal) will be doing race changes for evils over level 30
  affected by this if desired (up to and including racewar change if you want) for &+Wone week only&n 
  (until Wed, 14/6/06). Please don't bug the other gods if they don't want to bother 
  with this.

&+R6/06/06&n
- &+GEpic Zone Trophy&n
  Right now, there are 81 epic zones on Duris. Since the beginning of the wipe, only
  48 of them have been done, and many of them multiple times.

  Due to this, the Gods of Duris have implemented an epic zone trophy system. If you
  keep doing the same zone over and over, the non-pvp epics you receive will decrease.
  You can "roll" the trophy like mob trophy, but it would be even better to take
  this opportunity to discover the zones out there that you've never done before!

  The command "epic trophy" will show you the epic zones you have accomplished.

- The "epic" command will show you the top players on both sides by epics.
- Tracks left behind by players will now no longer give the race name.
- Enhance spells available to psionicists are now bonus type spells instead
  of basically setting stats to 100.

&+R5/06/06&n
- Shadow shield used to be better than stone skin for some reason.
  It isn't anymore.

&+R4/06/06&n
- The spells magic missile, chill touch, burning hands, acid blast, shocking grasp, 
  lightning bolt, cone of cold, ice storm, fireball, bigby's clenched fist, and bigby's
  crushing hand have been recalibrated to be more or less a linear progression in damage 
  instead of the total willy-nilly they've been for the past 10 years. Fist and hand do
  approximately the same damage as they did before, but their failed spell save damages
  aren't quite so ridiculous.
  These are all still subject to being balanced, so please don't panic.
- Stone skin, shadow shield and biofeedback are now not stackable with each other.
- Air magi are now perm haste, and their hastes and air form spells also last a bit longer.

&+R3/06/06&n
- The harm spell has been upped to be between cause critical and full harm.
- Ice storm now takes longer to cast.
- Good-raced characters less than level 30 will no longer lose exp when dying.
- Paladins and Anti-paladins have been revamped.
- Necromancer pet vampires have WAY more hitpoints and take up slightly more slots.
- Reaper pet shadows have fewer hitpoints, take up more slots, and are in general less cheesy.

&+R2/06/06&n
- The defend skill has been removed, and guard has been totally revamped, and is 
  usable by Guardians, Paladins, and Anti-Paladins.
- Stoneskin was replaced with shadow shield for sorcerers.
- Casting time for fists, crushes and detonates was slightly increased.
- Prices for rare ores have been reduced.

&+R31/05/06&n
- Swordsmen have taught their Guardian brothers how to perform the follow-up riposte
  maneuver, and then forgotten how to do it themselves.

&+R30/05/06&n
- Spellweave should work as expected now, there were reliability issues.

&+R29/05/06&n
- Goodie groups will now find themselves receiving not as much experience if they
  have too many people in the group.

&+R27/05/06&n
- Sorcerers have learned a new 10th circle spell
- A few of the bash fail messages are a little more intuitive now.

&+R26/05/06&n
- Swordsmen (warrior specialization) have learned how to triple and quadruple attack
  at a lower level than their unspecialized colleagues.

&+R25/05/06&n
- Mercenaries now receive a money reward for bartender quests after level 25.

&+R24/05/06&n
- If you are unsure where to go to obtain your next level, ask your teacher.
- Bartender quest exp is alot more rewarding now. Have fun.
- Bandages are slightly less effective, making the higher end bandages a more usefull.
- Passive tracking disabled, i'll see if i can manage to balance this somehow, but
  it was very lame as was.
- Fixed bug where you magically got transferred to other peoples' lockers sometimes.
- Fixed frag <class|race|good>.

&+R23/05/06&n
- Necromancer NPCs are no longer lazy, they will try to find corpses
  on their own. It may take them some time but be warned!

&+R22/05/06&n
- Shopkeepers around the world realised that ore, prices should be more static. 
- Epic command disabled, no reason to display this. Since lvl are based on this
  you get a good idea of peoples epic by typing who!
- Bug with some old transaction code, where shop keepers would take treasure in 
  your inventory if you didt have enought money, been removed. 
  Thanks for reporting.
- You can no longer bandage your self in locker.

&+R22/05/06&n
- Paladins have forgotten how to cast the 'heal' spell.
- Anti-Paladins learned how to cast the 'energy drain' spell.
- Paladins and Anti-Paladins have learned how to master the bash skill.
- Ferry ticket automats will now show the list of destinations and the ETA
  of the ferry.

&+R21/05/06&n
- Ports 433 and 4444 are now open
- The AC of new random shields will be comparable to other existing shields.

&+R20/05/06&n                                                                   
- Wizards have lost arcane block and gained spellweave instead. This
  skill remains to be balanced.
- Paladins' lay hands innate has been toned down.
- Ferry tickets have gotten a little more expensive.
- Upgraded unmaking a bit.
                                             
The races of &+rDuris&N have evolved...
&N&+bOgres&N, &+LMino&N&+rtaurs&N, &+gCen&+Ltaurs&N, and &+gTrolls &Nare the only large races. &+BBarbarians &Nhave
been reduced in size to medium and gained more moves. A shield is grand thing to
have as they grant much more armor class.  &+rRogues&N are again the only class to be
able to trip; meanwhile, &+WRe&+Lave&+Wrs&N have learned to springleap, &+GRangers&N have forgot
how it was they once bashed, and the time a victim must stay on the ground after
being lept at has been reduced.  Likewise, &+RMauling&N and &+LGazing&N now take less of a
toll on others. &+BWarriors&N who attempt to bash without a shield worn also may note
their victim standing a bit sooner. &N&+cHitters&N have had their hitpoints downgraded.
&+YMountain Dwarves &Nand &+rDuergar Dwarves&N have survived long against magic. Thus, the
Dwarves have developed a damage reduction innate towards the most general magic.
The &+RGnomish&N Schools of Engineering and Magic have finished their work on another
advancement for their race: &+bultravision&N. The condition of your armor affects the
amount your armor protects you, keep it in excellent &+Crepair&N. &+gDruids&N are now more
closely guarded with their spells; no longer will others benefit by serendipity,
also regeneration is now self only. Summoning cyclones now takes longer. Shields
are no longer usable by the fledgling &+gDruids&N. Rumors state, upon specialization,
the skill returns.  The &+YConjurer's Conjecture&N daily has reported that a new copy
of the Conjurer Spellbook has come out.  The effects minorly paralysis will fade
faster as will the unconsciousness resulting from headbutt. The time of &+Rhard&N&+rcore&N
is no more. The time when &+gDruids&N and &+WRe&+Lave&+Wrs&N strayed from their prime classes is
no more, they may no longer multiclass.  &+WPaladins &Nand &+LAnti-Paladins&N were granted
new innate auras to aid their groups in exchange for their spells of protection.
&+LAnti-paladins&N can now 'descend' into the depths of evil and become dreadlords.
(&+mNecromancers &Ndecided it was too dangerous&N).  &+yGuardians &Ncan now guard and defend.


&+mNecromancer &Nspecs have been swapped around:
&+mDiabolis&N necros have studied how to create powerful golems, the art of
unmaking corpses to heal themselves, and how to search the ground in
order to exhume corpses. They are also masters of the power of undead,
to the point where they can cast the destroy undead spell.

&+mNe&+Lcrol&N&+myte&N necros are the masters of groups of undead; their pets never
turn on them, and they can see corpses on the overland map. They also
have proficiency in staffs of all sorts (but they are no longer
masters), and are able to control slightly more undead. They also
automatically mummify a corpse if they happen to strike the killing blow.

&+LReaper&N necros seek after the living in order to bring them to the realm
of the dead. They are excellent hand-to-hand fighters with stabbing or
slashing blades, and they are able to summon a doom blade to slash their
foes. They can summon the shadows to attack with the power of the mind,
and have learned how to return to life while in a vampiric trance via
their new "remort" command.

&+WThe Economy of &+rDuris&N &+Wis changing...&N
The Shopkeepers of Duris have joined in a pact: to adjust the prices in relation
to how common the item is.  They have introduced a new line of products as well,
&+Wbandages&N which can be found in any local store or learned about in help bandage.
&+cFirst Aid&N is now the life saving command and can be used more often.  The way in
which prices were done for quests has changed. &+yBartenders&N the world over will be
glad to give them out. How often they are done affects the experience earned and
money given. The &+GWit&N&+gch Doc&+Gtor&N has grown too frail to wander about the mountains.
The new economy has allowed Ramous to make additions to his town; &+CVerspin&N is now
much more interactive, also.  A "pitty" area has been added to the town as well.
The Council of Shipwrights have spent much time in deliberation, they decided to
create some price adjustments on the four types of ships they now make.  The vast 
&+gswamps&N of the continent of evil have become infested with all sorts of nasty
creatures.  Furthermore, the &+LDark&N&+yPeak&N mountains have become overrun with greedy
orcs that populate the cities located therein.  The hometown of the &+GGoblins&N has shifted
to a new location, and three new &+GGoblin&N areas have been discovered.  The great and
versatile &+yFerry System&N has also seen great improvements, including new ferries and
an all around faster ride.  The village of &+RTentro&N has been found, and also the
high elf city of &+YShaledrieth&N, guardians of a mystical &+Ysunwell&N.  Time to explore!
&+yMercenaries&N are now the true bounty hunters, the only class able to earn money as
a bonus to completing bartender quests.  More on &+yFerries&N, they now appear as an &+WF&N
on the map.  The SeaStalker's ferry route has been changed, going from the Piers of Fehlnan
to the Jade Empire to Fort Boyard and back, for only the price of a ticket!
When someone bids on an auction, the ending time is now postponed 5 minutes.

Regarding experience and levels...
Experience has become harder for all.  The effects of trophy on experience shall
be noticed by all; yet, moreso by &+rEvils&N. &+rEvils&N also will notice that exp doesn't
go as fast if their group size is any bigger than three. Additionally, &+rEvils&N can
not regain as much experience after being &+Wresurrected&N. The experience derived by
Player vs Player, if within range, is more substantial.  &+WAdvancing past level 45
&+Wrequires epics, see help epic for exact numbers. &N Also, only twice per level can
you complete a bartender quest; only two per real-life day may be completed once
you attain level 50 and above.

A few not so minor, miscellaneous changes...
The artifacts of &+rDuris&N have been located by a wise &+Ycreature&N somewhere in &+gAvarne&N.
The &+Celite&N&+y guards of &+GWoodseer &Nhave grown tired of the constant abuse, expect more
security by the Halflings. &+WRolling you character has no randomness to it. Ingame
&+Wyou may improve your stats for a bit of cash.&N The magical, amazing power of some
swords has been lost: &+GPathfinder&N and the &+rflaming&+L gre&Nats&+Lword &Nno longer respond to
commands. Due to the Guild Golem union, Golems are no longer required to work as
hard when they deny you access. They lightly shove you down now which will allow
you to stand immediately. The &+ymaps&N of &+rDuris &Nhave changed: &+ybeaches&N now abound for
your docking pleasure. &+RThe inhabitants of &n&+rDuris&+R have forgotten how to form ranks
&+Rin combat.

The Nuts and Bolts...
Upon login, the game now automatically picks &+RA&+BN&+GS&+YI&N terminal. &+rDuris is up on a new
machine and should work much better: steps have been taken the step to &+Rdual core&N
and &+Y64bit platforms&N.  Also, multiple &+Ldisc drives will now make pfile backup much
more secure! The mud has not moved.
