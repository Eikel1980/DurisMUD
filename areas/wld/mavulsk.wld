&n&+wBefore the&n&+L Stone Mansion~
   To the north lies the&n&+L Stone Mansion&n&+w where&n&+r Th&n&+Le Bar&n&+ron of Mav&n&+Lulsk&n
sits upon his throne.  A huge double door, made of stone blocks
the northern exit.  The building is constructed so its northern
parts are located deep inside the great mountain.  From here it
appears to be a two-floor building but one can't tell how many
floors there are inside the mountain.  Originally this was the areas
only building made by&n&+L Orc&n&+w's and&n&+r Duergar Dwarves&n&+w to defend their
mine close by.  After being abandoned for several years a tribe of
&n&+rMino&n&+Ltaurs&n&+w arrived and settled here.  The village has grown around
the mansion and is now more of a small town than a village. &n

&nInside the St&n&+Lo&n&+wne Ma&n&+Ln&n&+wsio&n&+wn&n~
   Inside the double stonedoor lies this hall with a floor is of solid
granite-stone.  The stone floor is the mountain that this hall has been
carved out from.  When the miner's first arrived here this was a cave but
they improved it as they dug further into the mountainside and made it
the entrance hall.  Now there are&n&+C mo&n&+Rsa&n&+cic&n&+w On the central Part of the floor
that continues through the exit north.  The walls are covered with carpets
with various motives and painted shields.  In both the eastern and western
wall there are wooden doors.

 grows the palisade moves further away from the center of town and
 the road follows with it. &n&+y The tanners&n&+w of the town have their work-

Inside the&n&+L Gates&n&+w of&n&+r Mav&n&+Lulsk&n~
   Here inside the citygates the&n&+r Cent&n&+Lral&n&+w Street begins.  The road is
paved with granite stone and it is kept very tidy and clean by the town's
street sweepers.  Looking north one can see the great mountain behind the
city.  The traffic has increased every year since the town was founded
some 20 years ago.  Most important to the economy is the trade with metals,
farming and fur trade and related goods.  At this time of day the road is
full of merchants traveling to the market or a guild meeting.  The town
was founded by a&n&+r Mino&n&+Ltaur&n&+w tribe but now they only stand for two thirds
of the total inhabitants.  The other third is dominated by&n&+L Orcs&n&+w and
&n&+CHumans&n&+w but other races can be seen occasionally.  The Baron's policy
is freedom of religion and to discriminate no one. &n

  The gates through the&n&+y palisade&n&+w into the city are heavily guarded by
soldiers On the ground and guards in the&n&+r Guard&n&+yhouse&n&+w above the gates.
The gate is made of&n&+r Pine&n&+ywood&n&+w strenghten with steel and looks fairly
resistant to violence.  The choice to use a palisade instead of a stone
wall was natural since the town has been growing so fast that a stationary
stone wall only would protect a small Part of the city after a couple
of years.  Below the gates stands a couple of fierce Minotaur Guards
and&n&+L The Co&n&+wntr&n&+Loller&n&+w who sees to that no known criminals or Cave Troll
are let inside.  Every since the Minotaur town was founded some 20-years
ago they've had trouble with a clan of Cave Trolls.

&+gand this room and its furniture are alose made of that tree.  In the

the majority of the customers consists of.  Smoke and loud conversations

&n&+LA R&nest&n&+Ling&n Area~
&+L   This room was once used as the resting area for the off-duty miner's
&+Lwho didn't have a long enough break to go back home so they sat here
&+Linstead playing cards.  The walls are of stone carved out directly
&+Lfrom the mountain and they are now covered with algae.  Against the
&+Lwalls stands various tools for mining work, but they look to be in
&+Lvery bad shape. &n

&+L   The tunnel ends here with a huge iron-strengthened oak door which blocks
&+Lthe northern exit.  The door is covered with moss and algae but the key-
&+Lhole seems intact.  The tunnel is dark and very moist and the walls
&+Lare covered with moss and algae the floor is covered with tools in
&+Ldifferent state of decay.  To the east lies the former foreman's office
&+Land to the east lies a storage room for tools. &n

&n&+r   This room is rea&n&+Rlly hot, &n&+rthe walls &n&+Rare near&n&+rly glowing from heat.
&n&+rHeavy sulfur smoke&n&+R and sten&n&+rch hangs in&n&+R the air&n&+r.  In the tunnel a

&n&+LA Nat&nural T&n&+Lunne&nl in the M&n&+Loun&ntain&n~
&+L   The tunnel is more dry here than in the northern part and no moss or
&+Lor algae can be seen, neither On the walls nor the ceiling.  The tunnel
&+Lis dimly lit from some faint light source further ahead.  On the tunnel-
&+Lfloor lies some bones, from the size to tell they come from some small
&+Lanimals.  Two granite blocks stand on each side of the tunnel and serve
&+Las chairs for the trolls who stand on guard here. &n

&n&+LA Lar&nge Ca&n&+Lvern Ins&nide the&n&+L Mountain&n~
&+L   The tunnel ends here in a large cavern filled with smoke.  A fireplace
&+Ldimly lights the room and casts shadows across the cavern walls.  Over the
&+Lfireplace hangs a piece of &n&+rme&n&+Ra&n&+rt&n&+L.  And one can nearly swear that it is the
&+Lleg from a &n&+rMino&n&+Ltaur&n&+L.  Around the fireplace on safe distance sits a bunch
&+Lof trolls.  They fear the fire but nothing tastes like roasted minotaur
&+Lin these hard times.  The cavern floor is covered with all sorts of &nbones. &n
